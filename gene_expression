#Creates the table gene_expression. Have since altered the table in mySQL to set probeID and experiment as foreign keys to the probe and experiment tables. I then altered table to make experiment and probeID composite key. 

create table gene_expression (
experiment varchar (10) not null,
foreign key (experiment) references sample_info (sampleID),
expression integer not null,
probeID varchar(20) not null primary key);
